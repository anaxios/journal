<p>I think I'm going to disconnect this journal publishing thing from nb. I don't know maybe all the git stuff is worth it.</p>

<h2>02:16:02</h2>

<p>Adding a very flaky auto push to git feature to the journal publisher script. I wonder how nb does it without getting mixed up in merge conflicts?</p>

<p>I think I got links to work and ascii art to work too but I have to treat the files like markdown instead of plain text like I really want. I probably would have to write my own parser to  get that.</p>

<p>I added keybindings to turn links into markdown links in vim so I don't have to do it myself.</p>
