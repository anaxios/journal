<p>Refreshed my knowledge of vim buffers. I never use them but it is a hassle to not use the yank '0' buffer.</p>

<p>':reg' shows buffers.</p>

<p>To use a register:</p>

<ul>
<li>'"' then the buffer 'a' (or any register) then the action 'y' (or any available action).</li>
<li><p>To append to a register use 'SHIFT' then 'A'. macros are just key presses recorded into registers.</p></li>
<li><p>To start recording: 'q' then a register 'a'.</p></li>
<li>To run a macro: '@' then the register where it was stored.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started watching a Golang tutorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/x8LbnczFU0E?si=tKe5hF65rcO80Fgh">https://youtu.be/x8LbnczFU0E?si=tKe5hF65rcO80Fgh</a> I don't know if I want to learn a language right now, but I want to make a file upload app like 0x0.st or transfer.sh. I'm very tempted to just use Javascript and Hono like I always do. Apps that run from a single binary would be really nice.</p>

<p>Created keyboard shortcuts for <code>mpc toggle</code> <code>mpc prev</code> <code>mpc next</code> in KDE by doing the trick where you change what a script does by symlinking it to a different name.</p>

<p>KDE has a stupid shortcut system so I first wanted to use a hotkey daemon. I found this: <a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd</a> but I had to use debian in distrobox to compile it. Setting it up was not working. I got tired of fiddling and did it the KDE way. I really wanted the setup to be agnostic of what window manager/desktop I use.</p>

<p>Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I want to use Perl. As much a I love Bash, it gets pretty hairy pretty fast.</p>
