<p>I created and reworked a bash script that lets you talk to an llm. It currently works with ollama but I think it would be ez to setup chatgpt. It saves conversations and everything. I need to work on the output formating.</p>

<p>I'm looking for an ez self hosted file sharing service. transfer.sh looks interesting.</p>
