<p>I transferred Jacob's music to atreyu and used musicbrainz picard to ID the tracks. I'm doing the 'A's first. I'm using <code>find MUSIC_JACOBS/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname 'a*' -exec mv {} MUSIC/ \;</code> to move the files to a staging directory and then let picard work on them. It's very tedious and most of the albums are terrible grunty metal which I will never listen to.</p>

<p>For a more stable experience with nvidia:</p>

<pre><code>- set nvidia_drm.modeset=1 in grub
- bazzite you need to use rpm-ostree kargs --editor to change boot parameters
</code></pre>

<p>I have been having crashing issues with chad's computer and Bazzite. It locks up randomly. I hope the above will help, but I feel like it was already turned on by default.</p>
