<p>Tried to use the developer experience for Bazzite and it broke ssh-agent. I rolled back to standard bazzite. <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-dx">https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-dx</a></p>

<p>I made a really simple skeleton farm for bones and arrow from the spawner under my base.</p>

<p>I saw a video on youtube about how they cracked the Zodiac Killer cipher. The cipher text itself looks really cool. <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/zodiac-killer-cipher">https://www.dcode.fr/zodiac-killer-cipher</a></p>

<p>I've been working on a static site generator to publish this interstitial journal on the web. It's written in bash with a ascii art style.</p>

<p>Now that I'm publishing this I should write things that are interesting...</p>

<p>This is a test of the automatic weather function.</p>

<h2>22:02:56</h2>

<p>journal script will now insert the weather before entries but only once an hour so it's not repeating.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll get the current song from the mpd server too.</p>

<p>This journal thing is coming together. It's still a little sketchy. I wish there was a tool that actually did what I want when converting ansi escape codes to html.</p>
