<p>Writing from the future.</p>

<p>I'm writing this from artix which is in Eastern time zone it's actually 16:02:14 here. I'm not sure how to deal with this properly.</p>

<p>I created a script 'journal' that opens today's interstitial journal and if it doesn't exist it creates it.</p>

<p>I fixed the time zone issue by sending my time zone over ssh using an env variable.</p>

<p>Woke up early despite going to bed late. Ate two string cheese. My feet were tingly. Too many carbs or too much salt from the giant pile of Chinese food I ate. I'm resisting having leftovers.</p>

<p>I'm trying to organize Jacob's music. I tested a command line tool called beet on my library but I messed up and copied duplicates instead of doing the right thing. I'm trying Lidarr now to see if that works well. The problem is the library has a lot of messed up and missing tracks so its probably just going to be a huge pain.</p>

<p>Nik said he would share his 150 GB music library with me and I'll share mine in return. That would be awesome!</p>

<p>I set up mpd and rmpc to play music it was a bit of a headache to setup but it's working now.</p>
