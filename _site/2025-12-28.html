<p>Yesterday I used beet to organize my music library and it named duplicates with a '.' and a number at the end of the file. I used find to find them all and there weren't many so I used find to also delete them. I think I might start importing Jacob's music and do the same thing for the duplicates. I have 60 something GB of music and he has over 200 GB. It might take me a week to get through it all.</p>

<p>wrote a bash script that finds duplicate files by hash. It's in the scripts dir in dotfiles repo.</p>

<p>Found a Minecraft datapack 'JJThunder To The Max' that has extreme realistic terrain generation. I put it on bastian and loading a 3000x3000 chunk area to play around.</p>

<p>I finished the dedoop script. I added features to show a help message and an option for debug and whether or not to print the output to a file.</p>

<p>I'm heating up lasagna for dinner.</p>

<p>wodencafe from ##llama told me about <a href="https://xpra.org">https://xpra.org</a> "screen for X11" remote desktop software. I has a very cool feature of being able to forward single application that integrate into the local desktop well.</p>
