<p>I found <a href="https://juicefs.com">https://juicefs.com</a> which mounts an s3 compatible storage locally and encrypts the data in transit and at rest.</p>

<p>I also found <a href="https://bunny.net/">https://bunny.net/</a> to use as storage.</p>

<h2>05:01:46</h2>

<p>I ended up using backblaze as the backend to juicefs (bunny.net only has sftp). The setup of juicefs is a little involved but their docs are good enough that I figured it out. I set up encryption and postgres so I can connect to the volume from any computer on my tailscale network. The nice thing about backblaze is that 1TB is $6 so even if I wanted to upload Jacob's entire collection it wouldn't even be $3 a month to store. As it is now, it will be a few cents a month.</p>

<p>To mount the juicefs volume you need the RSA encryption key stored in the environment variable <code>$JFS_RSA_PASSPHRASE</code> you also need to to tell it where the database is and how to connect with a postgres url. I have it automount on artix with systemd because I can pass it the keys it needs automatically.</p>

<p>I couldn't get it to automount on atreyu because the juicefs binary is not able to be linked to the appropriate place in <code>/sbin/mount.juicefs</code> because that part of the filesystem is readonly.</p>

<p>I had to restore a database from backup because postgres changed a default and the container wasn't storing the databases to the volume. Luckily I made a backup with databasus.</p>

<p>I restored the backup with the wrong user, luckily I found this insane looking loop that I used to change the owner of each table back to the right user. I need to actually learn how to manage a postgres database and not just wing it like a cowboy.</p>

<p>Trying out <a href="https://github.com/swingmx/swingmusic">https://github.com/swingmx/swingmusic</a> to play music from artix. It's not bad. I would love to have an mpd frontend that streams the music to itself using mpd's http output.</p>
