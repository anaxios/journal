<h2>11:45:01</h2>

<p>I'm writing this from the cheapest motel in Nashville, TN.
I was kicked out of my parent's house and left to be homeless.
We had a major storm that left a few inches of snow on on the ground on Saturday and then Sunday turned the snow into ice with frozen rain.
The next few days are subzero but the storm was pretty mild here.
I'm very grateful and lucky to have been given the money for this motel during the storm.</p>

<p>It would have been a very terrible experience without the generosity of friends and also strangers from Twitter.</p>

<p>How to change TTL on macOS 12 and newer</p>

<p>Changing the TTL value may be useful. Especially, for those whose carrier restricts sharing Internet access through their personal hotspot. If you found this guide, I don’t think you need any explanation on what TTL is. This guide allows you to change the TTL value forever.</p>

<p>Step 1. Open Terminal. You can do this either by using Spotlight or through Launchpad.</p>

<p>Step 2. In the terminal window enter the following command:</p>

<p><code>
sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.sysctl.plist
</code></p>

<p>This command creates a file that will be launched on every boot up of your Mac. The file is empty right now, so we need to enter the instructions for the Mac to execute.</p>

<p>Step 3. The instructions themselves is the following text:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.startup.sysctl&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;LaunchOnlyOnce&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/usr/sbin/sysctl&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;net.inet.ip.ttl=65&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code></p>

<p>After pasting this into the file, press ^X combination to exit the file. When it asks to save the file choose “Yes”, then hit the Return key.</p>

<p>Step 4. The next thing we need to do is enter the following commands in Terminal:</p>

<p><code>
chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.sysctl.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.sysctl.plist
</code></p>

<p>Step 5. Restart your Mac.</p>

<p>Step 6. Open Terminal again and check if everything was done correctly with this command:</p>

<p><code>
ping 127.0.0.1
</code></p>

<p>If you see the TTL=65, then you’ve done everything correctly. If not, repeat the process again.</p>

<p>In case something went wrong or you just want to revert the changes, you can just delete the file. To delete it, enter the following command in Terminal:</p>

<p><code>
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.sysctl.plist
</code></p>

<h2>02:46:44</h2>

<p>I'm trying to figure out how to make the journal site better. I can easily put all the posts on one page. I played around with that last night.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I went to the local Assyrian bakery. The croissant was good. I look like a hobo and they seemed like they didn't want me there. It's weird how if a person looks like a crazy hobo they probably are a crazy person, but if someone looks like a well put together person they could be a crazy person too. Normal people don't try to make themselves look like crazy people but crazy people try to make themselves look like normal people.</p>

<h2>03:06:20</h2>

<p>It's 3 am and I had to close the window because of a strong perfume coming in. Who the fuck is up 3 am and what are they doing that would make such a strong smell that the neighbors have to shut their windows?</p>

<p>I think I fixed the journal script when it creates a new file for the day. I turned the weather ascii art into a stand alone script so I can use it directly.</p>

<p>I'm starting to use markdown in these files instead of the original plain text since they are primarily being viewed from html. I need to figure out how to make the pages searchable. My first idea is to render a single page version that can be 'Ctrl + F'ed in the browser. There's probably a more sophisticated way to do it but I kind of like the site being just html pages.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://juicefs.com">https://juicefs.com</a> which mounts an s3 compatible storage locally and encrypts the data in transit and at rest.</p>

<p>I also found <a href="https://bunny.net/">https://bunny.net/</a> to use as storage.</p>

<h2>05:01:46</h2>

<p>I ended up using backblaze as the backend to juicefs (bunny.net only has sftp). The setup of juicefs is a little involved but their docs are good enough that I figured it out. I set up encryption and postgres so I can connect to the volume from any computer on my tailscale network. The nice thing about backblaze is that 1TB is $6 so even if I wanted to upload Jacob's entire collection it wouldn't even be $3 a month to store. As it is now, it will be a few cents a month.</p>

<p>To mount the juicefs volume you need the RSA encryption key stored in the environment variable <code>$JFS_RSA_PASSPHRASE</code> you also need to to tell it where the database is and how to connect with a postgres url. I have it automount on artix with systemd because I can pass it the keys it needs automatically.</p>

<p>I couldn't get it to automount on atreyu because the juicefs binary is not able to be linked to the appropriate place in <code>/sbin/mount.juicefs</code> because that part of the filesystem is readonly.</p>

<p>I had to restore a database from backup because postgres changed a default and the container wasn't storing the databases to the volume. Luckily I made a backup with databasus.</p>

<p>I restored the backup with the wrong user, luckily I found this insane looking loop that I used to change the owner of each table back to the right user. I need to actually learn how to manage a postgres database and not just wing it like a cowboy.</p>

<p>Created keyboard shortcuts for <code>mpc toggle</code> <code>mpc prev</code> <code>mpc next</code> in KDE by doing the trick where you change what a script does by symlinking it to a different name.</p>

<p>KDE has a stupid shortcut system so I first wanted to use a hotkey daemon. I found this: <a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd</a> but I had to use debian in distrobox to compile it. Setting it up was not working. I got tired of fiddling and did it the KDE way. I really wanted the setup to be agnostic of what window manager/desktop I use.</p>
