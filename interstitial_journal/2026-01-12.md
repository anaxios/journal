I think I fixed the journal script when it creates a new file for the day. I turned the weather ascii art into a stand alone script so I can use it directly.

I'm starting to use markdown in these files instead of the original plain text since they are primarily being viewed from html. I need to figure out how to make the pages searchable. My first idea is to render a single page version that can be 'Ctrl + F'ed in the browser. There's probably a more sophisticated way to do it but I kind of like the site being just html pages.

To move panes around in tmux <prefix> + { (up) or } (down) or left or right depending on the layout.

To change the pane layout <prefix> + space.

I need to remember to move all the scripts that are required to use this journal and put them all in the repo so I can reproduce the setup.

I also need to mark down all the dependencies for the same reason.
