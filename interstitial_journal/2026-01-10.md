Refreshed my knowledge of vim buffers. I never use them but it is a hassle to not use the yank '0' buffer.

':reg' shows buffers.

To use a register:

- '"' then the buffer 'a' (or any register) then the action 'y' (or any available action).
- To append to a register use 'SHIFT' then 'A'. macros are just key presses recorded into registers.

- To start recording: 'q' then a register 'a'.
- To run a macro: '@' then the register where it was stored.

I started watching a Golang tutorial. [https://youtu.be/x8LbnczFU0E?si=tKe5hF65rcO80Fgh](https://youtu.be/x8LbnczFU0E?si=tKe5hF65rcO80Fgh) I don't know if I want to learn a language right now, but I want to make a file upload app like 0x0.st or transfer.sh. I'm very tempted to just use Javascript and Hono like I always do. Apps that run from a single binary would be really nice.

Created keyboard shortcuts for `mpc toggle` `mpc prev` `mpc next` in KDE by doing the trick where you change what a script does by symlinking it to a different name.

KDE has a stupid shortcut system so I first wanted to use a hotkey daemon. I found this: [https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd) but I had to use debian in distrobox to compile it. Setting it up was not working. I got tired of fiddling and did it the KDE way. I really wanted the setup to be agnostic of what window manager/desktop I use.

Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I want to use Perl. As much a I love Bash, it gets pretty hairy pretty fast.
