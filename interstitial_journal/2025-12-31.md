I transferred Jacob's music to atreyu and used musicbrainz picard to ID the tracks. I'm doing the 'A's first. I'm using `find MUSIC_JACOBS/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname 'a*' -exec mv {} MUSIC/ \;` to move the files to a staging directory and then let picard work on them. It's very tedious and most of the albums are terrible grunty metal which I will never listen to.

For a more stable experience with nvidia:

    - set nvidia_drm.modeset=1 in grub
    - bazzite you need to use rpm-ostree kargs --editor to change boot parameters
I have been having crashing issues with chad's computer and Bazzite. It locks up randomly. I hope the above will help, but I feel like it was already turned on by default.

The infection in my teeth that I've had for months is back. I went to the hospital and got antibiotic but they ran out of clindamycin. The gums under my nose is swollen and uncomfortable.
