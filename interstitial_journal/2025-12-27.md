Writing from the future.

I'm writing this from artix which is in Eastern time zone it's actually 16:02:14 here. I'm not sure how to deal with this properly.

I created a script 'journal' that opens today's interstitial journal and if it doesn't exist it creates it.

I fixed the time zone issue by sending my time zone over ssh using an env variable.

Woke up early despite going to bed late. Ate two string cheese. My feet were tingly. Too many carbs or too much salt from the giant pile of Chinese food I ate. I'm resisting having leftovers.

I'm trying to organize Jacob's music. I tested a command line tool called beet on my library but I messed up and copied duplicates instead of doing the right thing. I'm trying Lidarr now to see if that works well. The problem is the library has a lot of messed up and missing tracks so its probably just going to be a huge pain.

Nik said he would share his 150 GB music library with me and I'll share mine in return. That would be awesome!

I set up mpd and rmpc to play music it was a bit of a headache to setup but it's working now.
