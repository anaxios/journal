I think I'm going to disconnect this journal publishing thing from nb. I don't know maybe all the git stuff is worth it.

Adding a very flaky auto push to git feature to the journal publisher script. I wonder how nb does it without getting mixed up in merge conflicts?

I think I got links to work and ascii art to work too but I have to treat the files like markdown instead of plain text like I really want. I probably would have to write my own parser to  get that.

I added keybindings to turn links into markdown links in vim so I don't have to do it myself.

    - `xnoremap <leader>ml :s#\(https\?:\/\/\S\+\)#[\1](\1)#g<CR>`
